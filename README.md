## The project template was built with Create React App (https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## To run the production version, simply server the build folder, for example:
># npm install -g pushstate-server
># pushstate-server build

The server will start on http://localhost:9000

## To run the project in dev mode:

1. Install the npm dependencies
># npm install

2. Run the build and start the server on port localhost:3000
># npm start

## To just build the project:
># npm run build
